# GifTastic

### Instructions

Search gifs by clicking on buttons, the theme we have going is hip-hop artists.

 * New artists can be added using the form labeled `Add an Artist`

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Above every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).
